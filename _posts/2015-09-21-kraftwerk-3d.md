I had the chance to see Kraftwerk live at the Keller Auditorium a couple of days ago. The concert was part of the same tour that started at MoMA a few years ago but, honestly, I think it was the exact same show I saw in Benicàssim in 2004, but with 3D visuals. Not that I care, I still think it was great and all these classic robotic tunes are amazing and timeless.
