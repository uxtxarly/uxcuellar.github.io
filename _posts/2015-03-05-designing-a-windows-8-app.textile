Recently I had to design my first Windows 8 app. It ended up being fun, but the lack of resources and documentation (specially if you compare with iOS and Android) turned this into a challenging experience. Well I wish I had found this blog post before. Designer Katie Riley writes about her process and frustrations designing for Windows (pretty much the same ones I had) and she also shares some free resources, including an amazing "Sketch app template":https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59708940/Windows_blog/Windows8_kit.sketch.zip.
