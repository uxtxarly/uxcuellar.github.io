### The Story Behind This Project

In the Spring of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the live entertainment industry early and hard, and my employer Goldstar Events was no exception. We stopped selling tickets for live events and our revenue plummeted. With no certainties about when and how we would get back to regular sales, we had to pivot and find new paths for the company.

It is in this context that we discovered a market opportunity in the streaming of online events. In the last few months, we have seen a surge of online, home produced events, but they use streaming platforms that were not designed for this use case, and the user experience is far from smooth. We found that we could provide a professional platform for event organizers that would allow them to sell tickets, manage marketing and customer service, and produce premium quality streams, all in one place.

I contributed to this project by **designing the events organizer site**, where organizers create events and inventories, manage ticket transactions, and produce a professional streaming signal for their customers.

### Some Research First

This project was very different than anything else I did before at Goldstar. We were in a situation of emergency and we had to move fast, very fast. We took a few days to interview some of our closest partners and that allowed us to learn more about their workflows producing and selling online events, pain points, and needs. We also did a competitive analysis of similar services offered by other companies and we reused some of our existing personas.

### Ideation

Product managers, developers, and designers sat together and created an initial story map, prioritizing features for an MVP release that we needed to complete in less than three months. Some of our decisions here were based on user research, but we also had to make decisions based on stakeholder assumptions and our previous experience at Goldstar. We were lucky to work with some close partners that helped validate some of those assumptions.

One important decision that was made was to rely on third party solutions to manage payments and transactions (Stripe), marketing and analytics (Mailchimp, Toneden).

At that point, I was ready to start sketching wireframes and flows for the main sections of the organizer site.

### Test and feedback

I created some mockups and prototypes that were tested by our launching partners. From there, we first moved quickly to a working prototype, and then to beta versions of our MVP. We were able to do a soft launch in June, and we have been iterating and improving the platform since then.

### Things I learned

The pandemic and its consequences forced us to work like a startup: roles were fluid and everybody had a voice in the development process. That wasn't an issue, and the collaboration between teammates was great. 8 months later, I can say that was the foundation of a solid product that is going to be an important part of Goldstar's future.
