<p>I just migrated the content of this blog to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. I’ve been using <a href="http://textpattern.com">Textpattern</a> as my <span class="caps">CMS</span> of choice for years, but I wanted to try something new and my blog is the perfect place to experiment.</p>

<p>The process has been pretty smooth and I’m surprised of how easy it was to migrate the old content, posts and links. I might miss some things from <span class="caps">TXP</span>, like having a nice back-end or a search engine built-in, but it should be easier to tweak the design of this site using Jekyll and the workflow is very similar to the one I use at work. I am also hosting this in <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, what makes everything even easier.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m giving this thing a try for the next few weeks. I’ll keep changing things here and there and if I don’t like it I can always go back to <em>good ol’</em> Textpattern.</p>
