In the last few months I've been posting links about front-end style guides and related resources. Well, this one has them all. It's an extensive collection of articles, books, talks, tools and even podcasts about style guides and pattern libraries. I think one of these days I'll write a longer post about how we wrote the style guide that we use at <a href="http://mybigcampus.com/">My Big Campus</a>.
