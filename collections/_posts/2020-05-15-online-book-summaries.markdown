Have you ever read a reference book and thought “Welp, this could have been a Medium article”? If that’s the case, some new online services offer a solution for this: **book summaries that promise to give you the take-aways and nothing else**. I tried [getAbstract](https://www.getabstract.com/en/) and I found it pretty useful, but of course sometimes you will want to read the full book.
