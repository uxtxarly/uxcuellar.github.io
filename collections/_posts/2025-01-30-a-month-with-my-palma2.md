description: My personal experience with this phone-sized e-reader
---

So, I've spent the last month with what might be the most niche gadget of 2024 - the [Boox Palma2](https://shop.boox.com/collections/all/products/palma2). This phone-sized Android e-ink device was a surprise gift from my girlfriend (who clearly knows my tech obsessions better than anyone).

If you're not familiar with this quirky little device, picture a small e-reader that thinks it's a smartphone (complete with Google Play Store access) but doesn't make phone calls. It's one of those products with an almost cult-like following in certain tech circles, and now I understand why.

## What Actually Works (And It's More Than You'd Think)

The killer feature is obviously Google Play Store access, which immediately separates the Palma2 from most e-readers. Here's what I've been using daily:

- **Native e-book reader**: Surprisingly robust with solid AI integration for summaries and search
- **Libby & Kindle apps**: They run beautifully, which means access to my entire digital library
- **Plexamp**: Music without the battery-draining color screen? Yes please
- **Pocket Casts**: Perfect for podcast management, and the light theme works great on the e-ink screen

The e-ink screen gives these apps a different personality. Reading on this thing is genuinely easier on the eyes than my regular phone, even with all the blue light filters and dark modes activated.

## The "Well, What Did You Expect?" Category

Let's address the not-so-great experiences, though most are by design rather than flaws:

- **Video apps**: They technically run, but... why would you? The refresh rate makes them painful experiences, which is actually part of the appeal
- **Spotify & gradient-heavy apps**: The grayscale display struggles with anything using subtle color transitions
- **The native browser**: It's functional but very limited - I immediately replaced it with Vivaldi

The Palma2 isn't trying to be a do-everything device. It's deliberately limited by its display technology, which is precisely the point.

## The "Don't Even Try" List

There are some apps I've intentionally not installed, and I'm happier for it:

- **Social media apps**: I could install Bluesky, Instagram, etc., but that would defeat the entire purpose of the device
- **Google Voice**: If you really wanted to use this as a phone, this would be the solution (as long as you have WiFi), but I don't need that
- **Messaging apps**: No more distractions, please

## Is It Worth the Premium Price?

Let's address the elephant in the room: this thing isn't cheap. For what is essentially a single-purpose device (reading text), you're paying mid-range smartphone-level prices.

But here's where I've landed after a month: the Palma2 has fundamentally changed how I consume content. When I pick it up, I default to reading rather than scrolling. It's made me more intentional about my digital consumption.

Could I achieve the same by just using my regular phone with more self-discipline? Theoretically, yes. But in practice, having a dedicated device that makes reading pleasant and scrolling unpleasant has been worth every penny for me. I could also use a cheaper e-reader like the Kindle Paperwhite or the Kobo Clara, but those don't have access to the Google Play Store.

The simple act of switching devices creates a mental shift. When I grab the Palma2, my brain knows it's reading time, not endless-distraction time.

## The Verdict: Niche But Noteworthy

The Boox Palma2 isn't for everyone. If you're a casual reader who's perfectly happy with occasional Kindle app sessions on your phone, this might feel like an unnecessary luxury.

But if you're someone who values focused reading time, struggles with digital distractions, or simply appreciates purpose-built tools rather than do-everything devices, there's something special here.

It's a reminder that sometimes the best technology isn't the one that does everything well, but the one that does one thing exceptionally while deliberately making other things harder.
