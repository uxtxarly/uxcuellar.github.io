description: Matt Stein on how he uses Obsidian
---

I’ve tried to use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as my digital brain a couple of times, but I always keep going back to my trustworth [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/). The idea of storing everything in local Markdown files plus Obsidian’s plugin ecosystem is tempting. Still, I don’t want to deal with local installations and syncing in all the machines I use. And my brain is wired to write in an outliner, and Workflowy is the best. I’ve been wanting to write about how I use Workflowy for a while, I need to do it one day.
