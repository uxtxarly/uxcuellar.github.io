description: Some lessons learned after attending a customer conference in Vegas.
---

A couple of weeks ago I had the opportunity to attend Dimensions, the customer conference that my company organizes every year in Las Vegas. I was there as part of the Trimble UX team, to do some user research and get actionable feedback from customers. So I showed up there with a a small number of research activities for these users (card sorting, usability tests, buy-a-feature, interviews) but I only had partial success recruiting users. Here's what I learned for next year.

- We are competing for these customers' attention. They are there to attend as many events/seminars as possible, not to talk to us. We need short activities (15 minutes max), and we need incentives.
- The best place to recruit customers is in the rooms where the events are taking place. Booths and flyers don't work that well.
- If everything else fails, we need to have some unmoderated studies available that users can take when they have some free time.

Lesson learned for next year. Vegas (and Sphere), we'll be back.
