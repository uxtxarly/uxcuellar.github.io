###  A quick summary
- Designed a new dashboard page for Goldstar's Audience Marketing Platform.
- Interviewed event organizers and venue advisors to understand current user flows.
- Created new user flows and prototypes.
- Used remote usability testing of prototypes.
- Reviewed incremental implementation of the solution.

### The story behind this project
Another important part of the overhaul of Goldstar's Supplier Center was the redesign of the home page. The new Audience Marketing Platform wanted to encourage organizers to use its new tools and provide more inventory, and that's why we needed to highlight all these new features in a new home page.

In order to increase user engagement, we wanted this page to be not just a regular dashboard with data but a notification center with actionable notifications and alerts focused on creating value for organizers and easing venue advisors workload.

### Some research first
In order to understand how the organizers used the existing site, we did some remote user observation. Via video conference, we asked organizers to show us how they use the site, we asked about their goals, what they want to see in an iteration of these tools and what other channels and marketing tools they use to sell ticket inventory.

We wanted to consolidate this new knowledge and we also wanted to make it available to all team members. That's why we used it (in addition to previous interviews) to create two new organizer personas.

### How this works
The existing home page was just a sales summary that showed active events on the site and related remittance alerts, a pretty utilitarian design. We thought about what additional elements we could show in a dashboard page and how they would help the organizers. We started populating our list with banners, widgets, charts, and notifications that alert users if the inventory or the sales are low.

With that information, I paired with a visual designer and we created a number of wireframes that were reviewed internally first, and later shared with some organizers.

### Challenges I found
A lot of people was involved in this project and they all had different ideas about how to approach this new home page. I had to fight assumptions and design trends, and be an advocate for the user that didn't want to see his workflow disrupted.

We also decided that our primary user would be a smaller organizer, but we would still support advanced features for power users, allowing interoperability with other marketing tools by using export options.

### Implementation
A gradual implementation process was planned. Different parts of the new design were released each week and I helped developers and QA during this process providing feedback about the implementation.

### Things I learned
Don't break things. Observe the users and help them improve their workflows, don't disrupt them.
