### A Quick Summary
The project involved designing a new dashboard page for Goldstar’s Audience Marketing Platform to increase user engagement and streamline event organizers' workflows. Key activities included:

- Conducting interviews with event organizers and venue advisors to understand current user flows.
- Creating new user flows and prototypes.
- Running remote usability testing of prototypes.
- Reviewing the incremental implementation of the solution with developers and QA teams.

### The Story Behind This Project
As part of the comprehensive overhaul of Goldstar’s Supplier Center, we focused on redesigning the homepage for the new **Audience Marketing Platform**. This initiative aimed to highlight innovative tools, encourage organizers to provide more inventory, and boost engagement with the platform.

The existing homepage was a simple, utilitarian sales summary, showing active events and remittance alerts. However, we envisioned a more dynamic, notification-driven dashboard. The new homepage needed to act as both a **data hub** and a notification center, delivering actionable alerts to create value for organizers while reducing venue advisors’ workload.

### Some research first

#### Understading User Needs
To design a dashboard that genuinely addressed user challenges, we began with research:

- **Remote User Observation:** Using video conferencing, we observed organizers interact with the existing dashboard. These sessions revealed common pain points, current workflows, and opportunities to improve usability.
- **User Interviews:** We asked organizers about their primary goals, the metrics they valued most, and the additional tools or integrations they used to manage ticket inventory and sales.

#### Creating User Personas

Based on insights from these sessions and previous interviews, we developed two updated personas:

- Small Organizer Persona: Focused on user-friendly tools that provide clarity and quick insights.
- Power User Persona: Requires advanced features like export options and integration with external marketing tools.

### Designing the Dashboard

#### Goals
The dashboard needed to:

- Surface actionable notifications (e.g., low inventory alerts).
- Provide essential performance metrics in easily digestible visualizations.
- Support both small organizers and power users without disrupting existing workflows.
- Highlight new tools in the Audience Marketing Platform to boost adoption.

#### Prototyping and Feedback
1. **Wireframing:** We developed multiple wireframes featuring:
- Banners for promotional tools.
- Widgets for real-time sales tracking and event performance.
- Notification areas to alert users to key tasks.
- Export options for integration with third-party marketing tools.
2. **Feedback Cycles:** After internal reviews, we shared prototypes with select organizers. Feedback led to iterative improvements, ensuring the design was aligned with user needs.

### Challenges Faced
#### Stakeholder Alignment
With many stakeholders involved, there were differing opinions on how to approach the redesign. I advocated for a user-centered approach, countering assumptions and trends that could disrupt workflows.

#### Balancing Needs
Our primary focus was smaller organizers, but we also needed to address power users' needs. This required careful prioritization of features to avoid complexity while ensuring flexibility.

### Implementation
To ensure a smooth transition, the rollout followed a gradual implementation strategy. Different components of the redesign were released weekly. My responsibilities during this phase included:

- Providing feedback to developers on design fidelity.
- Assisting QA teams in identifying and resolving issues.
- Gathering user feedback on released features to inform future iterations.

### Key Metrics and Results
- **Engagement Increase:** A 35% increase in dashboard interactions within three months of launch.
- **Notification CTR:** 65% of actionable notifications were clicked, driving more inventory submissions.
- **Error Reduction:** Help tickets related to dashboard navigation dropped by 40%.
- **Adoption of New Tools:** 50% of small organizers adopted promotional tools showcased on the dashboard within the first quarter.
- **User Satisfaction:** Post-implementation surveys showed a 4.6/5 satisfaction rate, with users praising the intuitive design and improved workflows.

### Lessons Learned
1. **Respect Existing Workflows:** Observing user behaviors and designing enhancements—not disruptions—ensures smoother adoption.
2. **Collaboration is Key:** Cross-team alignment and iterative feedback drive better results.
3. **User-Centered Decisions:** Balancing varied needs (e.g., small organizers and power users) is achievable with careful prioritization and scalable design solutions.

The redesigned dashboard effectively addressed user needs, boosted engagement, and streamlined workflows, proving to be a pivotal enhancement to Goldstar’s Audience Marketing Platform.
